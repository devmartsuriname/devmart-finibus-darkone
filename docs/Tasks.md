## === PHASE 8 ADMIN DASHBOARD CONSOLIDATION & ANALYTICS FOUNDATIONS ===

**Planning Date:** 2026-01-02
**Status:** ✅ PHASE 8 CLOSED (8A ✅ | 8B ✅ | 8C ✅)

---

### Phase 8 Objective

Consolidate and refine the Admin Dashboard and Analytics section using **first-party data only** and **existing Darkone components**. Internal operational visibility only—no external marketing integrations, no client-facing dashboards.

---

### Phase 8A — Dashboard Refinement ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED — 2026-01-02

**Implemented:**
- [x] Content Breakdown chart (Blog Published/Draft, Projects, Services)
- [x] Quotes Breakdown chart (Pending, Reviewed, Converted, Expired)
- [x] Enhanced `useDashboardStats` hook with granular counts
- [x] New layout: 4 rows (KPIs → Funnel/Source → Content/Quotes → Recent Tables)

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/(admin)/dashboard/components/DashboardContentBreakdown.tsx`
- `src/app/(admin)/dashboard/components/DashboardQuotesBreakdown.tsx`
- `docs/restore-points/Restore_Point_Phase_8A_Pre_Execution.md`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(admin)/dashboard/hooks/useDashboardStats.ts`
- `src/app/(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Guardian Rules Compliance:** ✅ All rules followed

---

### Phase 8B — Analytics Page Replacement ✅ COMPLETE & PARITY RESTORED

**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED, FIXED & PARITY RESTORED — 2026-01-02

**Implemented:**
- [x] Analytics KPI Cards (Total Leads, Total Quotes, Total Events, Funnel Conversion)
- [x] Events by Type bar chart
- [x] Quotes by Billing Period donut chart
- [x] Leads by Source donut chart
- [x] useAnalyticsStats hook for data fetching

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/(admin)/analytics/hooks/useAnalyticsStats.ts`
- `src/app/(admin)/analytics/components/AnalyticsKPICards.tsx`
- `src/app/(admin)/analytics/components/AnalyticsEventsChart.tsx`
- `src/app/(admin)/analytics/components/AnalyticsBillingChart.tsx`
- `src/app/(admin)/analytics/components/AnalyticsSourceChart.tsx`
- `docs/restore-points/Restore_Point_Phase_8B_Pre_Execution.md`
- `docs/restore-points/Restore_Point_Phase_8B_Analytics_QueryClient_Fix.md`
- `docs/restore-points/Restore_Point_Phase_8B_Analytics_Darkone_Parity_Fix.md`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(admin)/analytics/page.tsx` — Replaced placeholder with analytics dashboard
- `src/app/(admin)/analytics/hooks/useAnalyticsStats.ts` — Fixed QueryClient error
- All Analytics components — Corrected to match Dashboard 1:1 parity

**Runtime Fix Applied (2026-01-02):**

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| "No QueryClient set" error | `useAnalyticsStats` used `@tanstack/react-query` (`useQuery`) without `QueryClientProvider` in admin app | Rewrote hook to use `useState` + `useEffect` pattern matching `useDashboardStats` |

**Parity Correction Applied (2026-01-02):**

| Component | Issue | Fix |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| AnalyticsKPICards | Wrong icon wrapper, chart position | Matched DashboardKPICards: IconifyIcon + avatar-md wrapper, chart outside CardBody, height=50 |
| AnalyticsBillingChart | Missing stroke/fill, center label | Matched DashboardSourceChart: stroke: { width: 0 }, fill: { type: 'gradient' }, labels.show: false |
| AnalyticsSourceChart | Same as Billing | Same fixes applied |
| AnalyticsEventsChart | Wrong config/header | Matched DashboardFunnelChart: dataLabels, CardHeader pattern, card-height-100 |

**Why Dashboard Worked:**
- `useDashboardStats.ts` uses `useState` + `useEffect` (no external dependencies)
- Dashboard components follow Darkone template exactly

**Why Analytics Failed:**
- `useAnalyticsStats.ts` used `useQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query`
- Analytics components used custom configurations instead of Darkone patterns

**Fix Strategy:** A (Parity-safe) — Removed react-query usage, rewrote all components to match Dashboard 1:1

**Guardian Rules Compliance:** ✅ All rules followed
**Darkone_Reusability_Registry:** ✅ Referenced and respected
**darkone-assets-map:** ✅ Referenced and respected

### Phase 13D — System Toggles & Operational Controls (P2)

**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (13D.1 ✅ | 13D.2 ✅)  
**Planning Date:** 2026-01-05  
**Execution Started:** 2026-01-05

**Scope:**
- System-level toggles for operational control (Coming Soon, Maintenance Mode)
- Feature toggles for Quote Wizard and Contact Form
- Wire **existing** `/commingsoon` route to admin-controlled settings
- Create MaintenancePage component (mirrors Finibus patterns)
- Add System tab to Admin Settings using existing Darkone patterns

**Existing Frontend Route (REUSED — NOT CREATED):**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Route | `/commingsoon` |
| Component | `apps/public/src/components/pages/commingSoon/CommingSoonPage.tsx` |
| App.tsx Reference | Line 137 |
| Layout | Standalone (no Header/Footer) |
| Status | **EXISTS — 1:1 Finibus parity preserved** |

**Key Clarification:**
- The Coming Soon page **already exists** at `/commingsoon` (Finibus template)
- This phase wires that existing route to admin toggles — NO new Coming Soon page created
- Priority order: Maintenance Mode > Coming Soon Mode > Normal

**Proposed Settings Keys (5):**
| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `maintenance_mode` | `"false"` | Full site offline |
| `coming_soon_enabled` | `"false"` | Redirect to Coming Soon |
| `coming_soon_message` | `""` | Custom Coming Soon message |

- ✅ Public UI 1:1 Finibus (uses existing CommingSoonPage)
- ✅ No schema changes (INSERT only)
- ✅ No new dependencies

**Planning Document:** `docs/phase-13/Phase_13D_System_Toggles_Planning.md`

**HARD STOP:** Await explicit authorization before any execution.

**Completed:** 2026-01-01  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Public UI Ready

| Step | Description | Status |

### Phase 6D Admin: Quote Management UI (✅ COMPLETE)

**Executed:** 2026-01-01  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — DATA LINK VERIFIED

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 6D-A0 | Pre-Implementation Restore Point | ✅ Created |
| 6D-A1 | useQuotes Hook | ✅ Created |
| 6D-A2 | QuotesPage (List View) | ✅ Created |
| 6D-A3 | QuoteDetailModal | ✅ Created |
| 6D-A4 | Route Registration | ✅ /crm/quotes |
| 6D-A5 | Menu Item | ✅ CRM → Quotes |
| 6D-A6 | Post-Implementation Restore Point | ✅ Created |
| 6D-A7 | Data Link Fix | ✅ RLS Conflict Resolved |

#### Data Link Diagnosis (2026-01-01)

**Root Cause:** `.insert().select('id')` pattern requires SELECT permission, but RLS only grants SELECT to admin role. Public users could INSERT but not SELECT the ID back.

**Fix Applied:** Modified `QuoteWizard.tsx` to generate UUIDs client-side (`crypto.randomUUID()`) before insert, eliminating the need for `.select()` and subsequent `.update()` calls.

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/public/src/components/pages/quote/QuoteWizard.tsx` — Client-side UUID generation, reordered inserts

**Verification:**
- ✅ No schema changes required
- ✅ No RLS policy changes required
- ✅ Public app only (Finibus 1:1 preserved)
- ✅ Admin app untouched (Darkone 1:1 preserved)

#### Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `src/app/(admin)/crm/quotes/page.tsx` | Quotes list page |
| `src/app/(admin)/crm/quotes/hooks/useQuotes.ts` | Data fetching hook |
| `src/app/(admin)/crm/quotes/components/QuoteDetailModal.tsx` | View/edit modal |

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/routes/index.tsx` | Added /crm/quotes route |
| `src/assets/data/menu-items.ts` | Added Quotes menu item |

#### Features Implemented

- Search by reference, name, email
- Status filter dropdown
- Quote detail modal with items table
- Status update functionality
- Empty state, loading state, error state

## Phase 10C — About Page DB Wiring (✅ COMPLETE)

**Completed:** 2025-12-26

### Summary

Wired About page sections to database via `page_settings` table (page_slug='about') and fixed heading color parity issue.

### Key Changes

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fix WhyChooseUsArea heading color | ✅ Complete | Changed `black=""` to `black="black"` in AboutPage.tsx |
| Create useAboutPageSettings hook | ✅ Complete | Fetches from `page_settings` where `page_slug='about'` |
| Wire InsideStoryArea to DB | ✅ Complete | Uses hook with static fallbacks |
| Wire LatesNewsArea to DB | ✅ Complete | Section header from DB, posts from useBlogPosts |
| Remove date-fns dependency | ✅ Complete | Replaced with native Intl.DateTimeFormat |

### Date Formatting Standard (Phase 10C)

**Public app must NOT use external date libraries.**

Date formatting in `apps/public` uses native JavaScript:
```tsx
const formatDate = (dateStr: string | null): string => {
  if (!dateStr) return '';
  try {
    const date = new Date(dateStr);
    if (isNaN(date.getTime())) return '';
    const day = date.getDate().toString().padStart(2, '0');
    const month = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { month: 'long' }).format(date);
    const year = date.getFullYear();
    return `${day} ${month}, ${year}`;
  } catch {
    return '';
  }
};
```

- ✅ Settings (14 keys)
- ✅ Pages (6 pages, edit-only)
- ✅ Blog (6 posts, 10 tags, 8 comments)
- ✅ Projects (8 projects)
- ✅ Testimonials (6 testimonials)
- ✅ Leads (admin list + status/notes)
- ✅ Services (7 services, 21 steps, 6 pricing plans + media parity)

---

## Phase 5 — Public → DB Integration (✅ COMPLETE)

### Inner Pages Wiring Status

| Page | Status | Data Source |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Services List | ✅ Wired | `services` table |
| Service Details | ✅ Wired | `services` + `service_process_steps` + `service_pricing_plans` |
| Projects List | ✅ Wired | `projects` table |
| Project Details | ✅ Wired | `projects` + `project_process_steps` |
| Blog List | ✅ Wired | `blog_posts` table (published only) |
| Blog Details | ✅ Wired | `blog_posts` + `media` join |

### Homepage Wiring Status — STATIC BY DESIGN (Phase-Locked)

See: Section "Homepage Sections — Deferred" below.

## Phase 6.1 — Contact/Leads + Settings (✅ COMPLETE)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Contact form → leads INSERT | ✅ Complete | Honeypot anti-spam, client validation |
| RLS for leads INSERT | ✅ Complete | Anonymous INSERT allowed |
| Settings fetch hook | ✅ Complete | `usePublicSettings.ts` with fallbacks |
| Footer settings wiring | ✅ Complete | Email, phone, address, social URLs |
| ContactUsArea settings | ✅ Complete | Email, phone, address display |

**Works In:** Local development, production deployment.

**Decision:** Deferred. No architecture change authorized. Documented in `docs/restore-points/Restore_Point_Phase_6_Contact_Leads_Settings_Wiring.md`.
